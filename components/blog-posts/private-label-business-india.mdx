# What is private labeling and how does it work?

[Private label](https://www.shopify.in/encyclopedia/private-label) products, similar to white label products, are goods created by one company to be sold and branded by another company. 

A business owner selling private label products is looking for a product they can put their own brand name on and sell as if it’s their own. Clothing and cosmetics are common private label products, as are condiments sold in grocery stores.

As per Statista, the [global market for private label products](https://www.statista.com/statistics/443495/total-us-retail-sales/) is projected to hit $5.94 trillion by 2024. According to data, India has also been experiencing a rapid increase in the adoption of private labels as a business model.

## Growth of private labelling in India 

In India, about [38% of consumers](https://www.statista.com/topics/8166/private-labels-in-india/#:~:text=The Indian private label market,1700 billion dollars by 2026.&text=Private label companies accounted for,than other types of manufacturers) have tried new products or brands during the pandemic. As per the same study by Statista, more than 58% of consumers shifted brands due the unavailability of the preferred names and 21% made swaps to avail better value or offers. 

It’s safe to say that the pandemic has driven almost [20% of consumers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337323268_PRIVATE_LABELS_IN_INDIAN_RETAIL_INDUSTRY) to try and buy more private label products. As more consumers gravitate towards private labels across different categories, the gap between quality and affordability is getting bridged and retailers are now catching up with the trend to rapidly introduce new products and lines of their own brand. 

## Private Label Categories

Almost every consumer product category has both branded and private label offerings, including:

- Fashion and apparel 
- Personal care
- Beverages
- Cosmetics
- Paper products
- Household cleaners
- Condiments and salad dressings
- Dairy items
- Frozen foods

## Advantages of private labelling

Private labeling has a number of advantages that span beyond simplifying the product development process. Some of those advantages include:

- **Control over production**. You direct third-party manufacturers in terms of materials and ingredients, quality, and production rate.
- **Control over pricing**. As the seller, you determine your pricing strategy and have control over how you optimize production costs, which helps with creating a healthy profit margin.
- **Adaptability**. Smaller retailers can move quickly to get a private label product in response to rising market demand for a new feature, while larger companies might not pursue a niche product.
- **Control over marketing and branding**. You choose how to promote and package private label products before making them available for sale.

## Disadvantages of private labelling

While there are many benefits to private labeling, it doesn’t come without its challenges:

- **Manufacturer dependency**. Because a third-party manufacturer handles production, you’re largely at their mercy. That’s why it’s so important to find a reputable and reliable manufacturer to work with.
- **Difficulty building loyalty**. It can take time to get traction when starting a brand from scratch. This is one reason why private label products are great for people and brand names who already have an established audience that trusts them.
- **Poor consumer perception**. Private label products commonly have a reputation for being cheap or low quality. However, that perception is changing. Many consumers around the world believe the quality of private label products is improving.
